# 3D Rendering Scene

A simple 3D rendering scene built in C++ using OpenGL, Assimp, and other useful libraries. This engine allows users to load 3D models, apply textures, and render them with shaders and basic lighting, including a dynamic sun object. The scene also includes basic controls like camera movement and scene interaction.

## Project Description

This project is a basic 3D rendering engine that handles the loading of models and textures, basic scene management, and the application of lighting and shaders to objects in the scene. It features:
- **Camera Control**: Fly through the scene using keyboard and mouse input.
- **Lighting**: Sunlight simulation with dynamic lighting, including ambient, diffuse, and specular components.
- **Model Loading**: The engine uses the Assimp library to load 3D models from various file formats (e.g., OBJ, FBX).
- **Shader Program**: Custom shaders are used to render objects, with support for textures, materials, and lighting.
- **Scene Rendering**: Objects are rendered in a scene with models, textures, and shaders.

## Features

- **Camera Control**: Use the keyboard to move and rotate the camera and mouse to look around.
- **Lighting**: Dynamic sunlight that affects objects based on day time.
- **Model Loading**: Support for loading 3D models from external files using Assimp.
- **Texture Support**: Objects can be textured with external images.
- **Basic Shaders**: Custom shaders for handling materials, lighting, and textures.
- **Cross-Platform**: Can be built on different platforms like Windows and Linux (with minor adjustments).

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language used for the engine.
- **OpenGL**: Graphics rendering.
- **GLFW**: Windowing and user input.
- **GLEW**: OpenGL extensions.
- **Assimp**: Library for importing 3D model formats.
- **GLM**: Mathematics library for transformations, matrices, and vectors.
- **DevIL (Image Library)**: Loading and managing image textures.

## Usage

1. **Load a Model**: Models can be loaded by specifying the path to an `.obj` or `.fbx` file when initializing the `Object` class.
   
2. **Camera Controls**:
   - **WASD**: Move the camera around.
   - **Arrow Keys**: Look around with the camera.
   - **Mouse**: Look around by moving the mouse.

3. **Adjust Lighting**: The sun's intensity and position are updated dynamically, allowing for the simulation of a day-night cycle.

4. **Texture**: Textures can be applied to models. Ensure your texture files are in the supported format (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`).

5. **Day/Night Cycle**: The `Sun` object updates its position based on the time of day, affecting the sceneâ€™s lighting.
